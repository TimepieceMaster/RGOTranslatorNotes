	<p>
	This line from Konata in the intro, where she talks about a game where you can<br>
	talk to a fish person is in reference to the 1999 Sega Dreamcast game "Seaman",<br>
	in which the player raises a fictional creature known as the "Seaman".<br>
	While the Seaman takes on many forms throughout the game as it grows up,<br>
	its most iconic form is as "Gillman", in which it takes on the appearance of a<br>
	fish with a humanoid face.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, being able to talk to the Seaman using a microphone attached<br>
	to the controller was a major selling point of the game.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/seaman.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	There's also a second reference made in this line, with the part about the<br>
	fish girl who lived "at the top or bottom of a cliff". This is a reference<br>
	to the 2008 Hayao Miyazaki film, "Ponyo", which is about a humanoid fish girl<br>
	who goes by the same name. The Japanese name of the film is "Ponyo on Top of the Cliff",<br>
	and the film was also inspired by a book by Natsume Souseki called "The Gate" about a man<br>
	living at the bottom of a cliff. This is why Konata is uncertain about whether it was<br>
	the top or the bottom of a cliff.

	This line from Konata in the intro about counting the prime numbers<br>
	is in reference to the character Enrico Pucci, the antagonist of the sixth part<br>
	of "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure": "Stone Ocean". Specifically, a scene where he<br>
	counts the prime numbers in order to maintain his composure as poisonous frogs<br>
	fall down upon him.
	</p>
	<p>
	According to Pucci, the prime numbers give him strength due to their indivisible nature,<br>
	but clearly Konata does not have the same attachment to them.

	This has already been discussed in the Episode 1 and Episode 2 translator's notes, but to reiterate, this line is<br>
	in reference to an iconic scene from the series "Slam Dunk" where Hisashi Mitsui, a former basketball player<br>
	turned delinquent after a knee injury, breaks down in tears and wishes to become a basketball player once again<br>
	upon seeing his old coach whom he greatly respected.

	In this line from the intro, Konata's quote is a reference to a notable quote from<br>
	famous Japanese gamer and former Hudson Soft executive, Toshiyuki Takahashi, better known<br>
    as "Takahashi Meijin", meaning "Master Takahashi". This famous quote of his is as follows:<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	"Don’t play more than an hour of games each day.<br>
	Go out and play. Work and study hard.<br>
	When you do better, you’ll enjoy the games more, too.<br>
	You are the future of our country."
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/takahashi_meijin.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	As an additional fun fact, if you are familiar with Hudson Soft's<br>
	"Adventure Island" series, Takahashi Meijin is actually the protagonist<br>
	of the series, though the character was renamed to "Master Higgins" abroad.

	If you listen to the voice acting, or have seen the original Japanese line<br>
	for this moment where Konata carefully enters her password to log into Lucky Star Universe,<br>
	you'll notice that she says "BS, BS!". While it might be funny to imagine it as Konata<br>
	cursing at the computer, one of the names in Japanese for the "backspace" key on a computer keyboard<br>
	is the "BS" key. So Konata is merely just saying that she is pressing the backspace key to correct her mistake.

	"Oyashiro-sama's Curse".

	<p>
	Oyashiro-sama's Curse is a reference to the "Higurashi" series,<br>
	in which Oyashiro-sama is a deity that guards Hinamizawa, but is<br>
	said to curse you if you disobey his rules. The effects of the curse<br>
	is receiving what is known in the series as "Hinamizawa Syndrome",<br>
	a brain disease that causes severe anxiety, paranoia, and delusions. 
	</p>
	<p>
	One of Oyashiro-sama's rules has to do with being trustworthy,<br>
	and given that Konata believes the chair falling apart<br>
	leading to her bumping her head was Tsukasa's doing, she's accusing<br>
	Tsukasa of not being trustworthy with this line.

	The above reference is followed up on yet again with this line from<br>
	Konata, claiming that she sees that Tsukasa is holding a cleaver or a handsaw.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Of course, Tsukasa is actually holding neither. Instead, Konata is just making reference<br>
	to the characters Rena Ryuuguu from "Higurashi" and Kotonoha Katsura from "School Days".<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	For Rena, she has the nickname "cleaver girl" due to her use of a cleaver as a weapon<br>
	for killing people. For Kotonoha, she is known for killing people using a handsaw.
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, continuing the theme of distrust, both Rena and Kotonoha end up killing<br>
	as a result of distrust and paranoia. In Rena's case, it's due to the effects of<br>
	Hinamizawa Syndrone. In Kotonoha's case, it's partially out of suspicions that<br>
	a competing love interest is not actually pregnant, and so slices open her stomach,<br>
	discovering that there was in fact no baby inside.

	<p>
	This line from Konata near the end of the second intro scene about opening your "fifth eye"<br>
	is likely a reference to the "five eyes" talked about in Buddhism, with the five eyes being<br>
	the physical eye, the heavenly eye, the wisdom eye, the dharma eye, and the Buddha eye.
	</p>
	<p>
	While there is much you could learn about these kinds of eyes, I don't believe this reference<br>

	On the way to school on the first day, if the protagonist runs into Patty, she'll give him the above advice<br>
	when he starts to question how it is that he knows where the school is.<br>
	The line "Don't think, feel!" is taken from the 1973 martial arts movie "Enter the Dragon", starring Bruce Lee.<br>
	Notably, the movie was released just days after Bruce Lee passed away and was his last completed film appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
	The scene in which the line is said has Bruce Lee's character giving a lesson to a student about how<br>
	one needs to fight with "emotional content" and perform actions with feeling but not anger.<br>
	When the student then performs a kick to Bruce Lee's satisfaction, he asks how it felt, leading the student<br>
	to pause and think, but Bruce Lee scolds him for this, telling him "Don't think, feel!".

	<p>
	As part of Patty's strange ramblings if the protagonist runs into her on the way to school on the first day,<br>
	she says that the bridge you cross is "Namidabashi".
	</p>
	<p>
	Namidabashi, which translates to "bridge of tears", is a real bridge that existed in Sanya, Tokyo that has since<br>
	been demolished, but was so named due to it being the place where criminals would say farewell to family members<br>
	before crossing the bridge to be executed at the Kozukappara Execution Grounds.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, Patty's reference to the bridge is not because of that, but is instead due to the bridge's appearance<br>
	in the series "Ashita no Joe", which takes place in Sanya. The protagonist, Joe, crosses this bridge in the first<br>
	episode to enter Sanya, which is what kicks off the events of the series.
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, Danpei Tange, who takes Joe in and trains him to become a boxer,<br>
	lives in a shack located underneath Namidabashi.

	<p>
	Following the above rambling from Patty, she says "sieg moe". Though this may bring certain imagery to mind,<br>
    this is not a reference to Adolf Hitler, at least not directly.
	</p>
	<p>
	Specifically, this is a reference to a famous moment from "Mobile Suit Gundam", in which Gihren Zabi,<br>
	the series' main antagonist, gives a funeral speech for his brother, Garma Zabi, rallying the people of Zeon<br>
	to fight back against the Earth Federation. The speech ends by repeatedly chanting "sieg Zeon",<br>
	meaning "victory to Zeon".<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	So though it might seem like Patty may be making a highly questionable reference, and even though<br>
	comparisons are made between Garma Zabi and Adolf Hitler within Mobile Suit Gundam itself,<br>
	Patty is merely quoting this speech and declaring "victory to moe".

	Appearing immediately after the line from the previous note, Minami mishears "merchant" as "Maa-chan".<br>
	This is something that is a bit lost in translation, as it relies on the English loan word "マーチャント",<br>
	pronounced "maachanto", being something that could be plausibly misheard as something else in Japanese.<br>
	In Minami's case, she thought Konata was saying that Sunny wasn't actually her name, and that based on<br>
	her clothing, Konata could tell that Sunny was actually some character she was familiar with named "Maa",<br>
	with Konata adding the "chan" honorific to the end further emphasizing this point.<br>
	Of course, Konata wasn't actually saying that, and was just saying that Sunny looked like a merchant.
	</p>
	<p>
	It wasn't really possible to translate this misunderstanding into English. Since "マーチャント" is a loan word<br>
	that an English speaker playing this game would be able to clearly hear and understand means "merchant",<br>
	I was stuck having to think up things one might be able to mishear "merchant" as in English.<br>
	Unfortunately, there aren't any homophones of "merchant" in English, with the best mishearing I could come up with<br>
	being "myrrh chant", which is something that nobody would ever plausibly mishear "merchant" as. As a result,<br>
	I decided to simply literally translate the line and provide this note you are reading now as an explanation.

	In the original Japanese script, he actually says "まいうー" (maiuu), which is an anagram of the<br>

	as a reaction to good-tasting food. Nowadays, "maiuu" as a word is strongly tied to this show.

	<p>
	The name of the Unlucky★Sisters segment that occurs while the cast is travelling to the Dark Lord's castle,<br>
	"The Lack Swindler", is a parody of the 2003 manga "The Black Swindler", about protagonist Koshiro Kurosaki<br>
	becoming a swindler of swindlers to get revenge after his father lost his life savings to a swindler. As a swindler<br>
	of other swindlers, he becomes known as the titular "black swindler".
	</p>
	<p>
	The Japanese name of "The Black Swindler" is "kurosagi", which is a literal combination of the Japanese word for<br>
	"black" (kuro) and the Japanese word for "swindle" (sagi). The original Japanese name for the Unlucky★Sisters<br>
	segment parodies this name by removing the first letter in "kurosagi", resulting in "urosagi".<br>
	There is a word, "uro-oboe" (うろ覚え), in Japanese that means "vague memory" or "vague recollection", and this word<br>
	is used to tie the title of the segment to the idea that you can't have a vague recollection when it comes to knowledge<br>
    about scams.
	</p>
	<p>
	It was a nice coincidence for the English translation that removing the first letter in "black" results in "lack".<br>
	A lack of knowledge about scams is similar enough conceptually to a vague recollection of scam related knowledge,<br>
	so the parody carries over quite well. I suppose a "lack swindler" would be someone who swindles people who lack<br>
	knowledge about scams.

	In the Unlucky★Sisters segment that occurs while the cast is travelling to the Dark Lord's castle,<br>

	with Hinata saying this line followed by Hinata and Hikage shouting "DOOOON!" while pointing forward.
	</p>
	<p>
	Both of these things are in reference to the series "The Laughing Salesman". The statement from Hinata,<br>
	"We're here to fill the gaps within your soul" is based on the titular character, Moguro Fukuzou's, catchphrase:<br>
	"I'm here to fill the gaps within your soul". The pointing while shouting "DOOOON!" is an iconic action performed<br>
	by Moguro when insisting that one of his customers will either accept his offer or will follow the terms of an<br>
	offer they had previously agreed to. "DOOOON!", which is what the Japanese text is saying, is just an otomotopoeia<br>
	for a booming sound and was kept in Japanese due to the specific Japanese font and appearance of the effect being<br>
	an important part of the iconography, similar to the otomatopoeia used in the previous<br>
	Jojo's Bizarre Adventure reference.

	of Rinko. Additionally, Chun is voiced by Hiromi Konno, the voice of Akira Kogami in the Lucky Star anime.

	<p>
	As for Chun's outfit, there are two sources of inspiration. The first, in line with the other character's designs<br>
	in Lucky Star Universe, is some light inspiration from the MMORPG "Ragnarok Online".<br>
	Specifically, the male and female Mage class from the game.

	<img src="e3/female_mage_ragnarok_online.jpg"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	The second source of inspiration is the protagonist of the series "Fullmetal Alchemist", Edward Elric.<br>
	Primarily his color scheme of a red exterior color and a black interior color, as well as the white gloves that<br>
	both he and Chun wear.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	The reason for Chun's outfit being connected to Edward Elric will be explained in a translator's note further down.

	<img src="e3/chun_r_rgo.png"></img><br>
	<p>
	Chun's dialogue is written such that "are" and "our" are written as "R",<br>
	and many R sounds are emphasized. The reason for this is that in the original Japanese script,<br>
	Chun ends many of her sentences by saying the letter R, pronounced "aru". 
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/chun_r_japanese_rgo.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Normally in these situations where characters have special sentence ending words or sounds,<br>
	these will just be preserved as-is in a translation, but in Chun's case, things are actually<br>
	a bit more complicated.
	</p>
	<p>
	In Japanese, there are many words for the concept of "being". You have "desu" and "da", which<br>
	are a type of auxiliary verb known as a copula. Essentially, they are used for "X is Y" type sentences.<br>
	However, you also have the verbs "aru" and "iru", which are also auxiliary verbs used for various grammatical<br>
	purposes, such as describing things being in a certain state. They can also be used as regular old verbs to describe<br>
	the action of existing, with aru being used for nonliving things and iru being used for living things.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the 19th century, there was a simplified dialect of Japanese used for purposes of trade and basic communication<br>
	with foreigners in which all of these various "being" words got reduced down just to "aru". I will refer to to this<br>
    dialect as the "aru" dialect from here on for simplicity.<br>
	Places where this dialect was used included parts of China that were under the control of the Imperial Japanese Army,<br>
	and so there were some Chinese people who would've used this dialect.	
	</p>
	<p>
	As a result of this, it's become somewhat of a stereotype to indicate a character is Chinese in some Japanese media<br>
	by having them use the "aru" dialect. Though it is worth noting that Chinese people who are learning<br>
	Japanese don't actually end up speaking this way in real life.
	</p>
	<p>
	One example of a character that uses the "aru" dialect is China from the "Hetalia" series, who, as you can<br>
	likely infer, uses it to emphasize his role of being a stereotype of China as a country in general.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/china_hetalia.png"></img><br>
	A clip of China using this "aru" dialect in Hetalia can be seen here:<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXHzFRTok7w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXHzFRTok7w</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	So, as you can likely guess by now, because Chun is Chinese, the writers are having her<br>
	end her sentences with "R", which again is pronounced "aru" in Japanese, in order to<br>
	mimic the "aru" dialect stereotypically associated with Chinese people. This is true,<br>
	but it is worth noting that this is not simply the same as having the "aru" dialect<br>
	but replacing the "aru" with "R". Instead, this dialect is being taken to a comedic extreme,<br>
	such that it's not as if Chun is simply using "aru" for all "being" words as a dialectic simplification,<br>
	but is literally saying the roman alphabet letter "R" at the end of sentences for no apparent reason,<br>
	in a way that resembles overuse of "desu" in stereotypical "Westerner Japanese" used by people like Patty.<br>
    In fact, in the above line, Chun even uses the verb "aru" in a way consistent with how it would be used in<br>
    standard Japanese (i.e. not just the "aru" dialect), but then appends "R" to the end of it, creating "aru R".
	</p>
	<p>
	In short, while Chun's use of R is meant to mimic the Chinese stereotype, it's also meant<br>
	to come off as someone randomly adding "R" to the end of sentences in a comedic fashion.<br>
	This is why I have chosen to adapt this by having Chun randomly emphasize R sounds in English.

	Tsukasa will say her catchphrase "Dondake!" in response to Shadow explaining how she eats salted rice porridge<br>
	for three meals a day. As explained in the Episode 2 translator's notes, "dondake" is a slang term that is<br>
	derived from the Japanese "doredake", meaning "how much?" or "to what extent?". However, "dondake" is mostly<br>
	just used by Japanese high school girls as a general exclamation of surprise, and is similar to "oh my god" in English.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	However, Tsukasa's use of "dondake" is also likely a reference to its use in Gintama, being described as an<br>
	exclamation for "boke" or "funnyman" type characters in Japanese comedy, which Tsukasa is meant to be.<br>

	If the protagonist and the rest of the party successfully escape capture by Chun's henchmen,<br>
	and the protagonist asks Sunny and Shadow if they have trouble going outside, Konata will comment<br>
	on how his question seems like a roundabout way of asking if they are hikikomori.
	</p>
	<p>
	For those who do not know this term, a hikikomori is a shut-in, someone who lives in social isolation<br>
	and stays at home as much as possible and often does not have a proper job. While the reasons one may<br>
	become a hikikomori are varied, this specific term tends to carry a connotation of a Japanese person who is<br>
	disillusioned by the idea of living a normal life as an employed person, due to things like Japan's<br>
	work culture, or a lack of good job prospects in an area of work that the person is passionate about. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Hikikomori are also stereotypically associated with otaku culture, with their otaku interests<br>
	being a factor in why they cannot find work or do not wish to have the responsibility associated with<br>
	a standard job in Japan. Consequently, such hikikomori may attempt to make money through their otaku interests,<br>
	such as by trying to make money from online games, or from producing doujin in the form of comics, stories, games,<br>
	and other creative works. This is why the protagonist thinks Sunny and Shadow may be hikikomori upon hearing that<br>
	they joined Chun's Happiness Program and sell doujinshi in order to make a living.

	Before entering the abandoned labyrinth, Tsukasa suggests they use her divination powers<br>
	to help them figure out what path they will need to take in order to make it through.<br>
	She then performs a technique she calls the "Mimizu Method".<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	What Tsukasa is actually performing is "water divination" as seen in the series "Hunter x Hunter",<br>
	in which a person takes a glass of water with a leaf sitting on top of the water, and focuses their<br>
	aura on to the water. Depending on the change that takes place in the water, it determines<br>
	the affinity of that person's aura. This is why Konata later explains that Tsukasa's ability doesn't<br>
	actually predict the future or anything like that, but instead just determines the class someone is<br>
	best suited for, as is the case with water divination.

	<p>
	Additionally, the name "Mimizu Method" is derived from what "water divination" is called in Japanese,<br>
	which is "mizumi-shiki". In the original Japanese script of Ryouou Gakuen Outousai, Tsukasa calls it<br>
	"mimizu-shiki". There is also the additional reference in that the kanji used to write the "Mimizu"<br>
	in "Mimizu Method" is "美水", which can also be read as "Yoshimizu", and is the way you write the<br>
	last name of Lucky Star's creator, Kagami Yoshimizu.

	What's important to understand here is that a player being "designated for assignment"<br>
	indicates an intention on the part of the team to get rid of the player in some fashion.
	</p>

	That is to say, because Tsukasa isn't going to be of much use, she's jokingly being placed<br>

	One of the dialogues that can be found within the labyrinth has the protagonist recall that a famous<br>
	hunter once said that when people are lost they will tend to go left. He then also concludes that it may<br>
	be dangerous to go left as a result. As it turns out, while there's no danger in going left at this junction<br>
	in the labyrinth, going right at this point will take you to the hidden Trading Card Shop in this Episode,<br>
	so this line is actually somewhat of a hint to the player.
	</p>
	<p>
	As for the hunter being referenced by the protagonist, that would be the character Kurapika from the series<br>
	"Hunter x Hunter". He says this during the Hunter Exams in Episode 13 of the 1999 anime series during a section<br>
	where he and four other hunters have to traverse through Trick Tower, making decisions as a group<br>
	by pressing either the "X" or "O" button on special wrist timers. When the group decides to go right at a junction,<br>
	Kurapika provides this fact as the reasoning for why going right was the better choice over left.<br>
	Because people who are lost tend to go left, the people running the Hunter Exams would have taken this fact<br>
	into account by making the left path more difficult.

	This line that the protagonist says during the 5th appearance of Minoru Shiraishi within the labyrinth<br>
	contains two references. The first is the quotation "If the cuckoo does not sing, wait for it",<br>
	which has been referenced many times before at this point. He is quoting a poem taught to Japanese children<br>
	about the different approaches taken by Japan's three great Daimyo, illustrated by three different responses<br>
	to a cuckoo not singing. In this case, the protagonist is saying to employ the method of Tokugawa Ieyasu by<br>
	waiting for Minoru Shiraishi to speak on his own rather than trying to compel him to speak.
	</p>
	<p>
	The second reference is more interesting, that being the "Min-min mirakuru Minorun-run", which is a lyric<br>
	from a parody of the song "Koi no Mikuru Densetsu" performed by Minoru Shiraishi. "Koi no Mikuru Densetsu"<br>
	is the opening song to the movie the SOS Brigade makes for the culture festival in the<br>
	"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" anime series.

	In the 6th and final appearance of Minoru Shiraishi within the labyrinth, Minoru gives the protagonist<br>
	an envelope containing 1,000,000 teek, equivalent to 10,000 Japanese yen. Minoru apparently claims that<br>
	the money was something the protagonist had lost and so Minoru was returning it, though we don't directly<br>
	hear him say this.
	</p>
	<p>
	The quote we do get from the protagonist, repeating what Minoru told him, has been left in Japanese<br>
	due to it being important for preserving what is being referenced, though it is explained with the third<br>
	line in the dialogue box. "Wa-wa-wa-wasuremono, ore no wasuremono" translated literally would be<br>
	"f-f-f-forgotten thing, my forgotten thing". In the original Japanese version of this line, it was not him<br>
	quoting Minoru, but instead merely the protagonist stuttering while asking for confirmation that the money<br>
	is in fact being given to him under the belief that he had lost it, which could be translated as<br>
	something like "F-F-F-Forgot this? I forgot this?".<br>
	<p>
	However, this change was again made so the line could both make sense in English,<br>
	as well as preserve the reference that I am about to explain.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the episode "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 4" in the "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"<br>
	anime series, after a dangerous encounter, Kyon is on the floor of his classroom holding on to<br>
	Yuki Nagato when one of Kyon's friends, Taniguchi, walks in on them and misinterprets the scene<br>
	as Kyon having a romantic moment with Yuki. Taniguchi is actually voiced by Minoru Shiraishi,<br>
	and while recording the lines for this scene, Minoru ad-libbed Taniguchi singing to himself about how he left<br>
	something behind in the classroom and was going back to get it. This ad-libbed line was none other than the<br>
	"wa-wa-wa-wasuremono" being referenced.
	</p>
	<p>
	Though this line did get translated into English dubs as "f-f-f-forgot my bag", the English version of this line<br>
	didn't garner anywhere near the level of notoriety that the Japanese version did.

	stealing her first kiss from him. In response to this, some fellow bullies admire Dio for his boldness.

	In the first bad ending of Lucky Star Universe, when Chun has the protagonist and the others<br>
	surrounded, she says the above line. It may seem like a very over-the-top translation of what<br>
	Chun is actually saying, "yacchimaina", which has a more straightforward translation of simply "get them",<br>
	but as you can probably guess, it's written this way because it's referencing something.
	</p>
	<p>
	Specifically, this line is in reference to the 2003 American film "Kill Bill: Volume 1".<br>
	A scene later on into the film is a confrontation between the film's protagonist, Beatrix "the Bride" Kiddo,<br>
	and one of the film's antagonists, O-Ren Ishii. After unsuccessfully trying to take down "the Bride"<br>
	with individual henchmen, O-Ren commands all of her lackeys to take her down all at once<br>
	by shouting "yacchimaina" which the film translates in an exaggerated fashion as "TEAR THE BITCH APART!".
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition to the Ryouou Gakuen Outousai scene being somewhat similar to the scene from "Kill Bill",<br>
	another thing to note is that the character O-Ren Ishii is meant to be half-Chinese. Since Chun is Chinese<br>
	as well, this may have contributed to the decision to reference this line during this moment.
	</p>
	<p>

	In the final face-off against Chun, when the protagonist and the others catch her off guard with not many of<br>
	her henchmen present, Chun is forced to resort to using her special "transmutation" powers.
	</p>
	<p>
	These powers of transmutation are a reference to the "Fullmetal Alchemist" series, in which alchemists are able<br>
	to use these same transmutation powers to manipulate matter. Most alchemists in that series must use a<br>
	transmutation circle in order to perform transmutation, but a small number of alchemists, such as protagonist<br>
	Edward Elric, can do so simply by clapping his hands together. This is why both the clapping of hands and the<br>
	use of a transmutation circle are featured in the CG. There's a good possibility that Chun's clothing was made to bear<br>
	some similarity to Edward Elric's in order to really help sell this reference.
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, it may be worth noting that in the universe of "Fullmetal Alchemist", transmutation generally can't<br>
	be used to summon living beings in the way that Chun does. This kind of transmutation may be considered a form of<br>
	"human transmutation", which is deemed to be impossible. So that would contribute to the idea that Chun<br>
	would have to be cheating in order to have this kind of ability.

	</p>
	<p>
	The original Japanese line, "oinochi choudai!", is a line famously associated with the character<br>
	Recoome from "Dragon Ball Z". In episode 64 of the original anime, Recoome says this near the end of his battle<br>
	against Vegeta before the former prepares his powerful "Eraser Gun" attack.
	</p>
	<p>
	This is another example of a line that doesn't have the same notoriety in English. The English dub<br>
	of Dragon Ball Z didn't even translate this line, opting instead to just have Recoome shout at this moment.<br>
	This was later changed in Dragon Ball Z Kai's dub to "It's time to die!". However, I have opted for how it is translated<br>
	in the subbed version of Dragon Ball Z, as it is the more faithful translation of the two.

	In the Ayano Lucky Lucky Memorial route, on the morning of the first day, the protagonist<br>
	will say "Oh no! I'm late! I'm gonna be so late!", but his words will be distorted and muffled<br>
	due to having a mouth full of bread.
	</p>
	<p>
	As crazy as it may seem, in the original Japanese script, this line was written in such a way<br>
	to resemble a particular type of speech known as "misakurago", or "misakura language".<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Misakurago is named after illustrator Nankotsu Misakura, who is of unknown gender and appearance.<br>
	They primarily illustrate sexually explicit light novels, and pretty much all examples of misakurago<br>
	are of a sexually explicit nature, so be aware of that if you research this yourself.
	</p>
	<img src="e3/misakurago_example.png"></img>
	<p>
	It was difficult to find a good example of misakurago that wasn't explicit, but the above panel from<br>
	a comic by pixiv user "酔拳使い O)))" has the necessary components of misakurago that I want to illustrate.<br>
	It is of a businessman impressed by a business proposal that he just saw, calling it "incredible".<br>
	Of course, his speech has had the markings of misakurago applied to it.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first and most obvious marking of misakurago is elongating the end of words by holding out the<br>
	final vowel. This can be seen with the repeated お's at the ends of both of his speech bubbles, which<br>
	when read out loud turns things like the "no" in "sugoi no!" (it's incredible) into "sugoi noooooo!"<br>
	(it's incredibleeeee!).
	<p>
	<p>
	The second marking of misakurago, which is harder to recognize if you can't read Japanese, is what I call<br>
	the "mushification" of certain syllables. Without going into full detail on how Japanese words are constructed,<br>
	for some syllables ending in the vowels "a", "u", and "o", such as "ka", "su", and "ho", there exists a similar<br>
	syllable that adds a sort of "y" sound in the middle, such as "kya", "syu", and "hyo". When written in hiragana,<br>
	these syllables will have these small ゃ, ゅ, and ょ symbols following a larger character, resulting in constructions<br>
	like きゃ, しゅ, and ひょ. By replacing syllables with these versions that have the "y" sound added, it can give a<br>
	kind of "mushy" feeling to the pronunciation of words. Using the above image as an example, it turns "sugoi"<br>
	into something pronounced closer to "shugoi". This comes across similarly to pronouncing the English word<br>
	"incredible" as "incwedible".
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/misakurago_japanese_rgo.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Looking at how the line from Ryouou Gakuen Outousai appears in the original Japanese,<br>
	hopefully you can now see the use of elongated vowel sounds and "mushified" syllables.
	</p>
	<p>
	To help see it, if we transform the above line from misakurago back into normal Japanese,<br>
	the line would be romanized as "yabai! okureru! chikoku suru!".<br>
	With the misakurago re-applied, it is "hyafahi! okureryu! chukyokyusuryuuuuuh!".
	</p>
	<p>
	Now, that's all well and good explaining how misakurago works and showing that it's being applied<br>
	to this line from the protagonist, but as for why the protagonist is being made to speak this way,<br>
	we have to return to misakurago's erotic origins.
	</p>
	<p>
	Again, as crazy as it may seem, it really does appear that the writers wanted to make a hidden joke in how they<br>
	wrote this line by having it be in misakurago. Due to it having similarities to muffled speech,<br>
	it works both to represent that his mouth is filled with bread and as a dirty reference for "those who know".<br>
	Perhaps a female character in a hentai would speak similarly if she had certain other substances or objects<br>
	in her mouth...

	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, there is another element to this reference that is unfortunately lost in translation.<br>
	In the original Hellsing manga, "search and destroy", though pronounced in English, is written as the<br>
	kanji compound "見敵必殺", which can be literally read as meaning "see enemy certain kill".<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/search_and_destroy_hellsing_manga.jpg"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	In the original Japanese line in Ryouou Gakuen Outousai, what Konata pronounces as "search and destroy"<br>
	is written in a way that parodies the kanji compound used in Hellsing, replacing the kanji for "enemy" (敵)<br>
	with the kanji for "moe" (萌), and the kanji for "kill" (殺) with the kanji for "fall" (落),<br>
	resulting in "見萌必落" and turning the literal meaning into "see moe certain fall (in love)".

	At the end of the Ayano Lucky Lucky Memorial route, when the protagonist reveals to Konata<br>
	that he intends to confess his love to Ayano, Konata shouts in surprise "WHAAAAAAAAAT!?" ("nanto!" in Japanese).<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	While the word "nanto" doesn't have any special significance in itself, the over-the-top way she shouts it<br>
	is intended to be in reference to Mobile Suit Gundam, in which this is a frequent exclamation.<br>
	In particular, she is imitating "Mobile Suit Gundam F91" protagonist Seabook Arno,<br>

	In the leadup to the Misao Lucky Lucky Memorial route, if the protagonist asks Misao for her thoughts<br>
	on Kagami's performance as Rin in the Archer Summoning Scene, it'll result in an interaction where Konata<br>
	ends up saying the above line.
	</p>
	<p>
	The "Man, Kagamis really are a great thing" part is a reference to Japanese film critic Haruo Mizuno.<br>
	Haruo would host the Japanese TV show "Wednesday Roadshow" (later "Friday Roadshow"), which is a program<br>
	that airs movies with some commentary before and after the film.<br>
	Haruo would often end the post-movie commentary section and sign-off the program with the line<br>
	"Iya, eiga tte hontou ni ii mon desu ne!" (Man, movies really are a great thing!).<br>
	This line became a popular catchphrase associated with Haruo Mizuno, and is what Konata is referencing.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/movies_are_great_haruo_mizuno.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	In the link below, you can see the post-movie commentary for the March 1997 airing of the 1996 Japanese film<br>
	"Shall we ダンス？" (Shall we dance). It was the last episode hosted by Haruo Mizuno.<br>
	He says the "Man, movies really are a great thing!" line at 1:32.<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVtkX82qj98">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVtkX82qj98</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	Sadly, Haruo Mizuno passed away on June 10th, 2008, only 5 months after the release of<br>
	Lucky Star: Ryouou Gakuen Outousai. This reference was likely a bit bittersweet for<br>
	many of those who recognized it back in the day as a result.

	In the Misao Lucky Lucky Memorial route, while the protagonist is walking to school on the first day<br>
	of the route, he monologues his doubts about being able to play Shirou properly in the Fate/Stay Night play.<br>
	As part of this, he wonders whether Miyuki and the others should've had him play "that "Wakame" guy" instead.
	</p>
	<p>
	"That "Wakame" guy" is in reference to the character Shinji Matou from Fate/Stay Night.<br>
	Shinji has the nickname "Wakame", meaning "seaweed" in Japanese, due to his hair bearing<br>
	some resemblance to seaweed.

	<p>
	As seen in the Misao Lucky Lucky Memorial route and elsewhere, Konata and Misao don't like each other<br>
	and refer to each other with derogatory nicknames. These nicknames are "Chibikko" for Konata<br>
	and "Misakichi" for Misao.
	</p>
	<p>
	The meaning of "Chibikko" is probably the more immediately obvious of the two.<br>
	It could be translated as "Chibi Girl" or "Chibi Kid".<br>
	Chibi is a word that has made its way into English and generally well-understood,<br>
	but for completeness refers to depictions of characters with tiny bodies and large heads.<br>
	Misao is comparing Konata to being like a chibi character because she is short in stature.
	</p>
	<p>
	As for Misakichi, it is derived from Misao's standard nickname, "Misa",<br>
	but with the suffix "kichi" added to it.<br>
	In Japanese names, "kichi" is a suffix associated with boy names, such as "Kenkichi" or "Yukichi",<br>
	and so by adding such a suffix to Misao's name, Konata is essentially making fun of Misao for being a tomboy.

	While Ayano is writing her romantic blog post in the Ayano mini scenario,<br>
	her thoughts are interrupted by the sound of a bamboo pole vender melodically shouting the words<br>
	"takeya, saodake" (bamboo seller, bamboo pole) on repeat.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	These bamboo pole vendors are something that you may not be familiar with unless you either live in Japan or are<br>
	sufficiently knowledgeable of Japanese culture, but these vendors will usually drive around residential areas<br>
	in trucks and use "takeya, saodake" as their "jingle" of sorts. In that sense, they can perhaps be seen as<br>
	similar to ice cream trucks. So this jingle Ayano is hearing is coming from such a truck driving around outside.
	</p>
	<p>
	As for why trucks would even need to drive around to sell bamboo poles of all things, this is because<br>
	historically bamboo poles have been used for the purpose of hanging laundry from in order to dry them<br>
	and so many are purchased for home use.<br>
	However, bamboo poles are quite long, and so would be difficult to transport back home if you had to go<br>
	to a store to buy them. The trucks are offering the convenience of being able to buy them at home since<br>
	they are bringing the poles directly to you.

	In the Misao mini scenario, if Misao chooses to check Kagami's bookshelf, after deciding not to<br>
	read "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya", she takes a look at another light novel with a similar<br>
	illustration style, but struggles to read one of the words.
	</p>
	<p>
	The book Misao is looking at is one of the "Shakugan no Shana" light novels, likely the first volume.<br>
	The reason Misao says that the artwork is similar is because both books are illustrated by artist Noizi Ito.
	</p>
	<img src="e3/shana_light_novel_cover.jpg"></img><br>
	<img src="e3/noizi_ito.jpg"></img><br>
	<p>
	As for the word that Misao is struggling to read, it's the word "nietono", written as "贄殿".<br>
	The reason she reads it as "nieden" is because "den" is one of the ways you can read the kanji "殿",<br>
	and so Misao simply chose the wrong reading. The word "nietono" is in reference to the sword "nietono no shana",<br>
	which is the sword the titular character Shana wields, as seen in the above cover art.
