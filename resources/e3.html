	<p>
	This line from Konata in the intro, where she talks about a game where you can<br>
	talk to a fish person is in reference to the 1999 Sega Dreamcast game "Seaman",<br>
	in which the player raises a fictional creature known as the "Seaman".<br>
	While the Seaman takes on many forms throughout the game as it grows up,<br>
	its most iconic form is as "Gillman", in which it takes on the appearance of a<br>
	fish with a humanoid face.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, being able to talk to the Seaman using a microphone attached<br>
	to the controller was a major selling point of the game.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/seaman.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	There's also a second reference made in this line, with the part about the<br>
	fish girl who lived "at the top or bottom of a cliff". This is a reference<br>
	to the 2008 Hayao Miyazaki film, "Ponyo", which is about a humanoid fish girl<br>
	who goes by the same name. The Japanese name of the film is "Ponyo on Top of the Cliff",<br>
	and the film was also inspired by a book by Natsume Souseki called "The Gate" about a man<br>
	living at the bottom of a cliff. This is why Konata is uncertain about whether it was<br>
	the top or the bottom of a cliff.

	This line from Konata in the intro about counting the prime numbers<br>
	is in reference to the character Enrico Pucci, the antagonist of the sixth part<br>
	of "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure": "Stone Ocean". Specifically, a scene where he<br>
	counts the prime numbers in order to maintain his composure as poisonous frogs<br>
	fall down upon him.
	</p>
	<p>
	According to Pucci, the prime numbers give him strength due to their indivisible nature,<br>
	but clearly Konata does not have the same attachment to them.

	This has already been discussed in the Episode 1 and Episode 2 translator's notes, but to reiterate, this line is<br>
	in reference to an iconic scene from the series "Slam Dunk" where Hisashi Mitsui, a former basketball player<br>
	turned delinquent after a knee injury, breaks down in tears and wishes to become a basketball player once again<br>
	upon seeing his old coach whom he greatly respected.

	In this line from the intro, Konata's quote is a reference to a notable quote from<br>
	famous Japanese gamer and former Hudson Soft executive, Toshiyuki Takahashi, better known<br>
    as "Takahashi Meijin", meaning "Master Takahashi". This famous quote of his is as follows:<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	"Don’t play more than an hour of games each day.<br>
	Go out and play. Work and study hard.<br>
	When you do better, you’ll enjoy the games more, too.<br>
	You are the future of our country."
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e3/takahashi_meijin.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	As an additional fun fact, if you are familiar with Hudson Soft's<br>
	"Adventure Island" series, Takahashi Meijin is actually the protagonist<br>
	of the series, though the character was renamed to "Master Higgins" abroad.

	If you listen to the voice acting, or have seen the original Japanese line<br>
	for this moment where Konata carefully enters her password to log into Lucky Star Universe,<br>
	you'll notice that she says "BS, BS!". While it might be funny to imagine it as Konata<br>
	cursing at the computer, one of the names in Japanese for the "backspace" key on a computer keyboard<br>
	is the "BS" key. So Konata is merely just saying that she is pressing the backspace key to correct her mistake.

	In the second intro scene, when Konata hits her head on a desk,<br>
	she blames Tsukasa and says it'll result in her receiving<br>
	"Oyashiro-sama's Curse".
	</p>
	<p>
	Oyashiro-sama's Curse is a reference to the "Higurashi" series,<br>
	in which Oyashiro-sama is a deity that guards Hinamizawa, but is<br>
	said to curse you if you disobey his rules. The effects of the curse<br>
	is receiving what is known in the series as "Hinamizawa Syndrome",<br>
	a brain disease that causes severe anxiety, paranoia, and delusions. 
	</p>
	<p>
	One of Oyashiro-sama's rules has to do with being trustworthy,<br>
	and given that Konata believes the chair falling apart<br>
	leading to her bumping her head was Tsukasa's doing, she's accusing<br>
	Tsukasa of not being trustworthy with this line.

	The above reference is followed up on yet again with this line from<br>
	Konata, claiming that she sees that Tsukasa is holding a cleaver or a handsaw.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Of course, Tsukasa is actually holding neither. Instead, Konata is just making reference<br>
	to the characters Rena Ryuuguu from "Higurashi" and Kotonoha Katsura from "School Days".<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	For Rena, she has the nickname "cleaver girl" due to her use of a cleaver as a weapon<br>
	for killing people. For Kotonoha, she is known for killing people using a handsaw.
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, continuing the theme of distrust, both Rena and Kotonoha end up killing<br>
	as a result of distrust and paranoia. In Rena's case, it's due to the effects of<br>
	Hinamizawa Syndrone. In Kotonoha's case, it's partially out of suspicions that<br>
	a competing love interest is not actually pregnant, and so slices open her stomach,<br>
	discovering that there was in fact no baby inside.

	<p>
	This line from Konata near the end of the second intro scene about opening your "fifth eye"<br>
	is likely a reference to the "five eyes" talked about in Buddhism, with the five eyes being<br>
	the physical eye, the heavenly eye, the wisdom eye, the dharma eye, and the Buddha eye.
	</p>
	<p>
	While there is much you could learn about these kinds of eyes, I don't believe this reference<br>

	On the way to school on the first day, if the protagonist runs into Patty, she'll give him the above advice<br>
	when he starts to question how it is that he knows where the school is.<br>
	The line "Don't think, feel!" is taken from the 1973 martial arts movie "Enter the Dragon", starring Bruce Lee.<br>
	Notably, the movie was released just days after Bruce Lee passed away and was his last completed film appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
	The scene in which the line is said has Bruce Lee's character giving a lesson to a student about how<br>
	one needs to fight with "emotional content" and perform actions with feeling but not anger.<br>
	When the student then performs a kick to Bruce Lee's satisfaction, he asks how it felt, leading the student<br>
	to pause and think, but Bruce Lee scolds him for this, telling him "Don't think, feel!".

	<p>
	As part of Patty's strange ramblings if the protagonist runs into her on the way to school on the first day,<br>
	she says that the bridge you cross is "Namidabashi".
	</p>
	<p>
	Namidabashi, which translates to "bridge of tears", is a real bridge that existed in Sanya, Tokyo that has since<br>
	been demolished, but was so named due to it being the place where criminals would say farewell to family members<br>
	before crossing the bridge to be executed at the Kozukappara Execution Grounds.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, Patty's reference to the bridge is not because of that, but is instead due to the bridge's appearance<br>
	in the series "Ashita no Joe", which takes place in Sanya. The protagonist, Joe, crosses this bridge in the first<br>
	episode to enter Sanya, which is what kicks off the events of the series.
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, Danpei Tange, who takes Joe in and trains him to become a boxer,<br>
	lives in a shack located underneath Namidabashi.

	<p>
	Following the above rambling from Patty, she says "sieg moe". Though this may bring certain imagery to mind,<br>
    this is not a reference to Adolf Hitler, at least not directly.
	</p>
	<p>
	Specifically, this is a reference to a famous moment from "Mobile Suit Gundam", in which Gihren Zabi,<br>
	the series' main antagonist, gives a funeral speech for his brother, Garma Zabi, rallying the people of Zeon<br>
	to fight back against the Earth Federation. The speech ends by repeatedly chanting "sieg Zeon",<br>
	meaning "victory to Zeon".<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	So though it might seem like Patty may be making a highly questionable reference, and even though<br>
	comparisons are made between Garma Zabi and Adolf Hitler within Mobile Suit Gundam itself,<br>
	Patty is merely quoting this speech and declaring "victory to moe".
