	NOTE: As with the previous guides for Episode 0, if a choice that's present in this Episode is not<br>
	mentioned here, it's either because it has no impact on anything, or because the same choice<br>
	appeared in previous episode(s), and so has the same impact on things like character favorability<br>
	that it did in those previous episode(s).

	they will recognize him when they are properly introduced during play practice on the second day.

	If you choose "of course", then the following scene of everyone being at school<br>
	late at night will be different than it was in Episode 2's and Episode 3's versions of Episode 0.<br>
	In this version, Kagami will suggest going to the convenience store for a snack break,<br>
	after which they will continue working.

	<p>
	If you choose "forget about it", the following scene of everyone being at school<br> 
	late at night will play out the same as in Episode 2's and Episode 3's versions of Episode 0,<br>
	in which Kagami will suggest going to the convenience store on the way home from school<br>
	once they are done working.
	</p>
	<p>
	Though Episode 4 proper is not available in this version of the patch,<br>
	picking "of course" is necessary in order to make progress towards Episode 4,<br>
	as it's only in that version of the following scene where the option to enter Episode 4<br>
	will end up appearing.

	Normally, it is at this choice where you are given the option to enter Episode 4 proper,<br>
