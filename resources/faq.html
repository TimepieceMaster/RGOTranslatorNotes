		No, the latest patch comes with Episode 1 and Episode 2 included, along with Episode 3.
		Download the latest patch from the link on the home page and you'll be all set to play everything available so far!

		<p><h4>Do I need a unmodified ISO each time, or can I "upgrade" my patch from a previous version?</h4></p>
		<p>
		The patch assumes you are working with an unmodified ISO. For me to allow for people to update to a new
		version from previous versions of the patch, I'd have to have a separate patch file to upgrade from each version,
		which would just lead to confusion.

		Yes, so long as your PSP or PS Vita is jailbroken to play homebrew and mods,

		<p><h4>Will you make a patch for the PS2 version?</h4></p>
		<p>
		There are currently no plans to make a patch for the PS2 version.
		</p>
		<p>
		The reason for this is primarily because of the additional effort required to maintain
		two versions, as well as the fact that a lot of work done on the PSP version would not work
		on the PS2 version due to the two versions not being exactly the same. The PSP version is the
		definitive version of the game with additional content and quality of life changes, so my focus
		is on providing the highest quality patch I can for that version rather than spread myself thin.

		<p><h4>I can't wait for the patch!<br>
		Is there some way I can experience the game in the meantime?</h4></p>
		<p>
		You're in luck! This patch actually is a continuation of a YouTube series I did from 2020-2024
		where I did a 100% playthrough of the game and translated everything along the way. While the translation
		in these videos is a first draft that can be a bit rough in places, it is accurate for the most part and got
		better as it went on. You can find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaPsBZmv6-Q&list=PLWvzX_LnnNLR_uA-TRVQk59YQxV4WciWj">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Currently, the patch for Episodes 1-3 is released, so if you want to continue from where the patch left off,
		you should start with part 94.
