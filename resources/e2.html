	As an additional fun fact, Ryouou Gakuen Outousai was originally supposed<br>

	A reference that gets lost in translation. In the intro scene,<br>
	when Kagami and Tsukasa are trying to make sense of the writing<br>
	on the paper they found on the ground, one of the terms that confuses<br>
	them is "pillar power", and they don't end up figuring out what it's<br>
	supposed to mean.<br>
	However, the Japanese word used is "注力" (chuuriki), which while "pillar power"<br>
	is how you would translate it and is what you might understand it to be if you<br>
	read it literally, this is likely in reference to the "jinchuuriki" (人注力).<br>
	Jinchuuriki are a class of characters in the "Naruto" series who have tailed beasts<br>
	sealed within them, with Naruto himself being the most notable of these characters.

	in English to "Idiots, Tests, and Summoned Beasts", though is usually<br>
    referred to as just "Baka and Test".
	</p>
	<p>
	The "femboy" Konata is referring to is "Baka and Test" character<br>
	Hideyoshi Kinoshita, a male character who has a very feminine appearance.<br>
	Notably, Hideyoshi is voiced by Emiri Katou in the anime adaptation,<br>
	the same voice actress that voices Kagami.<br>
	This is likely the reason Konata references Hideyoshi specifically.

	loved her performance.

	<p>
	Tsukasa's catchphrase of "dondake!" seen during the lunch scene on the first day is derived from<br>
	the Japanese word "doredake", meaning "how much?". However, it was mostly just used by high school girls<br>
	as an exclamation of surprise and doesn't necessarily mean the person is asking "how much?".<br>
	The catchphrase originates from Japanese make-up artist "Ikko", but also<br>
	was popularized from its appearance in the anime "Gintama", where it's also used as just a silly exclamation.<br>

	In the Episode 0 route, when the protagonist runs by the "Trading Card Shop",<br>
	there are four posters on the window, each of which is a real advertisement.<br>

	As Jotaro resists with his stand, Dio stays on the offensive, telling Jotaro that his attempts are futile by<br>
	repeatedly shouting the word "useless" at him.

	who had been accused of murder.
	</p>
	<p>
	Lelouch's command is successful due to the use of his Geass, "The Power of Absolute Obedience",<br>

	After being discovered by Hiyori and Patty, if the protagonist provokes them into fighting,<br>
	they will use their "trump card", which ends up being them making the above poses.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Hiyori's line about how she "didn't go to Summer Comiket for nothing!" is a reference<br>
	that also appeared in the Episode 1 translator's notes. It's a nod to the tagline said at the end of the<br>
	next episode previews in the "YuYu Hakusho" anime: "the other world isn't watching for nothing!".<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbMoV4TOvU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbMoV4TOvU</a>
	</p>
	Additionally, the "zero gun" is a reference to the "Spirit Gun", the signature technique of<br>
	YuYu Hakusho's protagonist, Yusuke Urameshi. The word "spirit" in Japanese is pronounced "rei",<br>
	which also happens to be a way of saying "zero" in Japanese, which is why Hiyori calls it the "zero gun".
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e2/spirit_gun_yuyu_hakusho.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Meanwhile, Patty's "turtle trap ha" is a reference to the famous "kamehameha" move from Dragon Ball,<br>
    and is protagonist Goku's signature move. The "turtle" part comes from the the Japanese word<br>
	for turtle being "kame", the "trap" part comes from the Japanese word "hameru" which means "to trap",<br>
	and the ha is just "ha". So it's kame + hame(ru) + ha = turtle + trap + ha.<br>
	Note that this is not the actual etymology of the "kamehameha".
	</p>
	<p>
	As for it being the "10x version", Dragon Ball has a variant of the "kamehameha" known as the<br>
	"10x kamehameha", which as the name implies, is a much more powerful version of the base "kamehameha".
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e2/kamehameha_dragon_ball.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Lastly, note that the pose Hiyori is doing more closely matches the pose for the "kamehameha",<br>
	while the pose Patty is doing more closely matches the pose for the "spirit gun".<br>
	This is intentional and is what the protagonist is later referring to when he says they've got<br>
	their poses flipped around.

	<p>
	When Hiyori and Patty first have the protagonist pinned down in order to blackmail him,<br>
	this exchange takes place. It's all a reference to a famous scene from the first "Yu-Gi-Oh!"<br>
	series where protagonist Yugi is able to defeat Haga via a maneuver that allows him to attack Haga<br>
	repeatedly, continuing long past the point where Haga has lost all his life points out of rage.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Yugi is eventually stopped by Anzu grabbing hold of him, to which he demands she let go of him.<br>
	Due to the scene's notoriety, Yugi's exclamation of "HANASE!" (let me go!) is often referred to by<br>
	putting stars between each syllable, making "HA☆NA☆SE!", possibly in reference to how the series name<br>
	"Yu-Gi-Oh" is also written with stars between each syllable in Japanese, "遊☆戯☆王".
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e2/let_me_go_1_yugioh.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	The "life points dropped to zero" line comes directly from Anzu telling Yugi to stop<br>
	as there's no longer any sense in continuing to attack Haga.
	</p>
	<img src="e2/let_me_go_2_yugioh.png"></img><br>
	<p>
	Lastly, the "it's our turn forever" line isn't something that's directly said in this scene,<br>
	but is instead Japanese internet slang derived from this scene, referencing how<br>
	Yugi's turn was able to go on seemingly indefinitely had Anzu not intervened.<br>
	People will often comment this during moments in turn-based games where a player has set themselves<br>
	up such that their turn is able to last a very long time without other players being able to act,<br>
	or fighting games when someone is pulling off a very long combo that their opponent can't break free from.

	references to the "Higurashi" series.
	</p>
	<p>
	The line "LIES!" itself is a famous exclamation associated with Higurashi,<br>
	with various characters shouting it with an intense expression throughout the story.<br>
	This includes the character Shion Sonozaki, whom is voiced by Patty's previous<br>
	voice actress, Satsuki Yukino. She also voices Shion's twin sister, Mion.<br>
	With Patty being voiced by Nozomi Sasaki in this game, this is what she means<br>
	by being her "successor" as Nozomi is succeeding Satsuki in the role of Patty.
	<p>
	<img src="e2/mion_shion_higurashi.png"></img><br>
	Mion (left) and Shion (right) Sonozaki as they appear in the original Higurashi visual novel.

	Following the above "Higurashi" references is this line from Hiyori and a CG<br>

	The line about being pushed down a well is a reference to how Shion ends up killing<br>
	several people in exactly this fashion.

	<p>
	<img src="e2/shion_well_higurashi.png"></img><br>

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrsi0jvIOiQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrsi0jvIOiQ</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	As for the CG, it's another notable moment from Higurashi involving Shion.<br>
	In a tense conversation with male protagonist Keiichi Maebara, he comes to the realization<br>
	that Shion would've been with the mayor of their village, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, just before<br>
	he disappeared. In response, Shion laughs hysterically, which is what Patty's laughing is based on.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the PS2 version of Higurashi exclusively, this scene is accompanied with a CG depicting<br>
	Shion's laughter by filling the screen with the Japanese onomatopoeia for laughter.<br>
	The CG seen in Ryouou Gakuen Outousai is based on this specific aspect of Higurashi's PS2 version.

	It's a reference to chapter 28 of the "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure" manga,<br>
	"The Hero of the 77 Rings", where Jonathan Joestar in a fight against Bruford,<br>
	finds himself underwater in a lake and needing to breathe. However, instead of<br>
	attempting to swim to the surface for air, Jonathan recalls some childhood advice from his father<br>
	that sometimes it's better to think in the opposite direction, doing what seems counterintuitive,<br>
	and swims to the bottom of the lake to find pockets of air underneath rubble.

	looks out into the harbor and sees a boat that has been shipwrecked, leading to the very first line of dialogue<br>
	in the game being simply "this is terrible". Due to it ironically being a fitting description of the<br>

	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, the line saw a resurgance in popularity in the 2000s on the Japanese TV Channel<br>
	"NHK Educational TV" due to an infamous scene involving Shouko Haida and puppet character Nyanchuu,<br>
	where Shouko accidentally pours eggs into a bowl of rice such that it started to overflow and spill out.<br>
	Nyanchuu's reaction of "this is terrible" in response to her blunder put the line back into<br>

	When trying to convince Konata to help, Hiyori asserts that she'll<br>
	even pay with her body, followed by Patty saying she will offer herself up as well.<br>
	Konata then responds by asking for a can of hot coffee.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	While I could not find confirmation of this, I believe this is likely a reference to the infamous "hot coffee"<br>
	incident that occurred with the 2004 videogame "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas". It was a controversy surrounding<br>
	an unused minigame contained within the game that depicted the game's protagonist CJ engaging in sexual<br>
	intercourse with his girlfriend. Though it was unused and not accessible in the game,<br>
	a mod known as "hot coffee" re-enabled it, generating a worldwide controversy as its existence became<br>
	known to the public. The mod is so-called because what did make it into the final game is implied sexual activity<br>
	that happens out of view when CJ's girlfriend invites him inside for coffee, which is where the unused minigame<br>
	was meant to occur.
	</p>
	<p>
	Hiyori and Patty's offer to pay with their bodies, which does often get used to imply allowing one's body to be<br>
	used for sexual gratification, combined with Konata's reference to coffee--specifically hot coffee--seems to be a<br>
	nod to this infamous event in gaming history. Additionally, the specific Japanese line that I have chosen to translate<br>
	as "YOU DON'T MEAN...!?" is "盛るの！？". Literally it is just "you'll serve (us with coffee)", but the kanji used is also<br>
	associated with sexual activity or being "in heat", meaning the line is implying that Hiyori and Patty are seemingly<br>
	interpreting Konata's request for coffee as being an invitation to sex.
	</p>
	<p>
	No footage or screenshots related to the "Hot Coffee" mod will be included here due to its sexually explicit nature<br>
	and due to me not being entirely sure whether this was actually intended to be a reference or if it's just a coincidence.

	The character Polnareff explains to Jotaro Kujo and the others that he tried to confront Dio,<br>
	who was at the top of a staircase, but whenever he would take a step up the stairs, he kept finding himself<br>
	descending the stairs instead. Polnareff figures it was the work of Dio's Stand: The World.
	</p>
	<p>
	In Japan, Polnareff's explanation became somewhat of an internet meme, where parts of his explanation<br>
	will be quoted in various scenarios where characters are explaining unbelievable things that have occurred.

    Patty mentions some dishes that could appear, with Hiyori alluding to Patty's dishes<br>
	being in reference to something.
	</p>
	<p>
	Patty was referencing the manga "Iron Wok Jan", in which the titular character Jan Akiyama<br>
	has an insane obsession with being the best chef and will do anything in order to win.<br>
	The dishes Patty lists are dishes that Jan made as part of a competition for young chefs,<br>
	and are examples of the lengths Jan is willing to go to.
	</p>
	<p>
	The "meal made with suspicious mushrooms" is in reference to a mushroom soup Jan made as his<br>
	first dish in the competition that he made specifically such that the mushrooms would combine<br>
	in such a way that it would have a hallucinogenic effect on the judges, making them obsessively<br>
	crave his soup.

	<p>
	<img src="e2/mushroom_soup_iron_wok_jan.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	The "dessert made with pigeon blood" is a reference to Jan's final dish in the competition<br>
	in which he brutally kills tons of pigeons in front of the audience and drains their blood<br>
	in order to make blood eggs as a highly unconventional dessert dish.

	During their infiltration into the school, while Hiyori and Patty are in the classroom with<br>
	a champagne glass and juice being used to represent wine, they have the above exchange,<br>
	making reference to two manga series based around host clubs.
	</p>
	<p>
	For those who may not know, a host club is a venue where women can go to receive<br>
	male entertainment in the form of spending time with a male "host" who will do things<br>
	like converse with them over alcohol or hold themed parties for them.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first manga series being referenced is "Ouran High School Host Club",<br>
	which the festival event is being named after.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e2/ouran_high_school_host_club.png"></img>
	</p>
	<p>
	The second manga series being referenced is "Yaou". "Yaou" (夜王) means "Night King" in Japanese,<br>
	so Patty is referring to it via a slightly different name by calling it "King of the Night" instead.

	During their infiltration into the school, while Hiyori and Patty are in the flea market classroom,<br>
	Patty says this line. Just to make this clear, "nomi no ichi" is the Japanese word for "flea market"<br>
	and literally means "flea market". That is, "nomi" is the word for "flea" and "ichi" is the word for "market"<br>
	in Japanese. So Patty is saying that when she's saying the English "flea market",<br>
	she means as in the synonym to "nomi no ichi" in order to help disambiguate it with the English "free market".<br>

	<p>
	To further add to what Miyuki says here following the "flea market" vs "free market"<br>
	conversation, "wasei-eigo" is a Japanese word meaning "Japanese-made English" and is used<br>
	to refer to instances where Japanese uses English words in ways that do not match how those words<br>
	are used in proper English. This can either be in the form of English words that get used differently<br>
	in Japanese, or entirely original English terms that are not terms people actually use in English.
	</p>
	<p>
	When Miyuki calls "free" a "wasei-eigo", she is referring to the former definition, as Japanese<br>
	tends to use the word "free" to mean "allows for any", which is not what "free" tends to imply in English.<br>
	For example, in Japanese the word "free size" (フリーサイズ) is used to refer to what would be called<br>
	"one-size-fits-all" in English. However, if you were to say "free size" in English,<br>
	people would probably try to interpret it as a size that does not cost any money.
	</p>
	<p>
	As for the latter definition, one example would be "my pace" (マイペース), which is used<br>
	to describe people who do things at their own pace with no sense of rush, even if it<br>
	comes at the cost at not having proper consideration for other people who may be waiting.<br>
	While the term is made up of English words, you would be hard-pressed to find someone<br>
	using the term "my pace" in an English context to refer to such a person. That is,<br>
	you wouldn't hear someone say "that person is very my pace".

	<p>
	This is a bit lost in translation, but the specific wording used in Japanese "gangan ikouze!" is the name<br>

	in them using their most powerful attacks with no regard for preserving their magic points.
	</p>
	<p>
	In Japan, "gangan ikouze!" is strongly associated with the Dragon Quest series as a term,<br>

	have the same reputation and merely is just the name of the tactic with no further notoriety.

	While it probably doesn't even need explaining given Patty said it straight out,<br>
	this line said by Hiyori when choosing to go to the gymnasium during their school infiltration<br>
	is a reference to the "Sherlock Holmes" series of stories created by Arthur Conan Doyle.<br>

	to the other two films in the trilogy: "The Matrix Reloaded" and "The Matrix Revolutions".

	In "The Matrix", the red and blue pill represent a choice made by protagonist Neo to either learn more about the Matrix<br>
	by taking the red pill, or to return to every day life unaware of the true nature of reality by taking the blue pill.<br>
	In Hiyori's case, one could associate the blue pill with rejecting what she saw and considering it to have just been<br>
	her eyes playing tricks on her, thereby allowing her to not have to face the reality where something like that could've<br>

	In this chapter, a girl from the university's manga club, Chika Ogiue, jumps out of a window to make<br>
	people feel bad for her. As a result of this incident, the titular club, "Genshiken" (an abbreviation of<br>
	"The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture" in Japanese), is coerced into accepting her as a member<br>

	the English translation of this moment went with the more liberal translation of "which is why I'm saying no" in<br>
	order to try and capture the nuance that otherwise couldn't be captured.

	</p>
	<p>
	These lines are a reference to the "Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!" segments from the 2000 visual novel,<br>
	"Tsukihime". Appearing after every ending in the game, the character Ciel will congratulate the player<br>
	if they manage to get a good ending, and will offer advice on how to do better if they get a bad ending.<br>
	Also featured in these segments is the mascot character and parody of main heroine Arcueid Brunestud,<br>
	named "Neco-Arc". Neco-Arc will often pout and argue with Ciel, with her pouting portait having the<br>
	Japanese text for "boo boo" annotating it. This is what Konata's line is referencing.
	</p>
	<p>
	Meanwhile, Kagami's line is more just to solidify that this is a reference to these moments from "Tsukihime"<br>
	by having her mention bad endings, since that's more what the "Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!" segments are<br>
	associated with.

	in the historical novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms". Zhuge Liang was known for being a great<br>
	military strategist, which is why Konata would compare her great idea to being of his caliber.
	</p>
	<p>
	The "Lord Kongming" referred to by the protagonist is actually just another name for Zhuge Liang.<br>
	More precisely, it's what is known as his "courtesy name", which is a name one receives as an adult<br>
	in certain Asian cultures and becomes the name a person is addressed as in formal contexts.

	If Hiyori and Patty went to the third year classrooms during their school infiltration,<br>
	the events Hiyori and Patty suggest for the contest Miyuki wants them to plan have an<br>
	element in their CGs that requires understanding the terms "yuri" and "bara" to fully appreciate.
	</p>
	<p>
	Yuri is a term used to refer to media featuring female-female homosexual relationships,<br>
	and it's later clarified that the "super intimate senpai-kouhai" pairings that would be<br>
	featured in Hiyori's proposed contest would both be girls, making it intended for an audience<br>
	that is into yuri.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, this meaning of "yuri" is actually a secondary meaning of the word. Yuri's primary meaning<br>
	is as the Japanese word for "lily", as in the type of flower. This is why the flowers drawn on the chalkboard<br>
	in the CG for Hiyori's event are lilies.
	</p>
	<p>
	Similarly, bara is a term associated with media featuring male-male homosexual relationships.<br>
	Also similarly, this is a secondary meaning of the word bara, with its primary meaning being as<br>
	the Japanese word for "rose", the type of flower. This is why the flowers drawn on the chalkboard<br>
	in the CG for Patty's event are roses, as she intends her event to involve male-male pairings.<br>
	This is also what Patty is getting at when she's talking about "surprises giving forth to a rose garden".
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e2/bara_2_rgo.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	However, as an aside, there is an interesting what you may call "oversight" with this.<br>
	You may notice that Patty mostly talks about her love for media with male-male homosexual relationships<br>
	as "BL" (Boy's Love) and not "bara". This is because the two terms are not interchangeable.<br>
	Media categorized as "BL", as well as it's related term "yaoi", tend to be made to appeal to heterosexual women,<br>
	while "bara" is made with homosexual men as the intended audience.
	</p>
	<p>
	As a result, the expression of love featured in works labeled as "BL" or "yaoi" tend to be more feminine<br>
	or mirror the kinds of dynamics seen in a stereotypical heterosexual relationship by having one of the men<br>
	take on the "feminine" role by being more submissive. This is why Patty's proposed event involves a kouhai<br>
    that is a "girl-at-a-glance", as he by being the younger person in the pairing makes him already well-suited<br>
    to being in the submissive/feminine role, which	is further emphasized by having them look like a girl.
	</p>
	<p>
	In contrast, "bara" media will tend to feature two men that are highly masculine with large masculine bodies.
	</p>
	<p>
	All this is to say that Patty's proposed event doesn't really fall under what people consider "bara" to be,<br>
	and so the use of roses in the CG to invoke bara is arguably inaccurate.

	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, Haruhi is known to give herself various titles throughout the series based<br>
	on the current goings-on, such as "Great Detective"(名探偵) and "Super Director" (超監督), often wearing<br>
	accompanying arm bands with the title written on it. The title on Hiyori's and Patty's armbands is one of<br>
	these titles Haruhi used, that being "Super Director", which she used when directing a movie for the school festival.<br>
	So given that Hiyori and Patty are directing an event at the school festival in these endings, the use of<br>
	this title is a fitting reference.

	<p>
	In the Patty Lucky Lucky Memorial route, during the scene where Patty is given the role of Taiga, the protagonist<br>
	asks Patty if she'll be fine reading the kanji in the script and offers to write furigana over the script as needed.<br>
	If you're at all familiar with the Japanese language, you will likely already understand<br>
	the concepts of kanji and furigana, but as a basic primer or refresher, there are three character sets<br>
	in the Japanese language: hiragana, katakana, and kanji.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Hiragana and katakana are native Japanese character sets that are phonetic in nature.<br>
	That is, each character has one consistent pronunciation. Hiragana and katakana<br>
	largely overlap in that most of the hiragana characters have a one-to-one match with<br>
	a specific katakana character, but are used in different contexts. Hiragana is mostly used for<br>
	writing many of the most common Japanese words, many words that originate from Japanese, and many<br>
	grammatical structures such as particles and auxiliary verbs. Katakana is mostly used for writing<br>
	loan words, primarily those that are not Chinese in origin. The hiragana and katakana character sets<br>
	are both made up of about 50 characters each, and due to their consistent pronunciation and overlap are often<br>
	learned fairly easily and quickly by most learners of Japanese.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e2/japanese_hiragana_katakana_chart.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	However, the third set of characters, kanji, is a character set adapted from the characters used in Chinese and are<br>
	used to write the majority of nouns and adjectives and the stems of most verbs.<br>
	There are several thousand kanji, with there being around 3000 characters that you need to know to be able to read<br>
	the majority of Japanese written material. Additionally, these characters can have many different pronunciations<br>
	that results in learners of Japanese simply having to memorize each word along with its kanji and their pronunciation<br>
	in that word. This has resulted in kanji gaining a reputation for being very difficult for learners of Japanese to read.<br>
	This reputation is arguably a bit overstated, but is not entirely unfounded, as this is a significant factor in why<br>
	Japanese is considered one of the most difficult languages for a native English speaker to learn.	
	</p>
	<p>
	But anyway, this is why the protagonist asks Patty whether she can handle the kanji in the Fate play's script.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e2/japanese_kanji.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	As for what "furigana" is, they are an aid that is added to some Japanese written material,<br>
	primarily that written for learners or Japanese children, that helps in reading words written in kanji<br>
	by placing the pronunciation of that word in hiragana beside or above the kanji version. Furigana is also<br>
	added in instances where a kanji word has an unconventional pronunciation or a pronunciation that otherwise<br>
	would not be likely known to the target audience.
	</p>
	<p>
	So, when the protagonist offers to add furigana to the script to help Patty, he's offering to notate the script<br>
	with how to pronounce the kanji words she struggles with, as he'll know how to properly pronounce them.

	the use of an IME (input method editor). An IME is a piece of software built into many devices<br>
	that helps in entering text in certain languages.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	The way it often works in Japanese is the user will simply type the words in their Romanized form<br>
	(i.e. how they are written using the Roman alphabet), and the IME will handle automatically converting<br>
	that text into hiragana. Additionally, as you type, a list of suggested words will appear, similar to autocomplete,<br>
	that you can select from to write words in kanji or katakana just by being able to recognize how it's written.

	Following the above mention of "Shuraba Mode" in the Hiyori mini scenario,<br>
	an explanation of the concept is given, which makes these historical references.<br>
	Again, it is helpful to understand that by "Shuraba Mode", we are really just talking<br>
	about the concept of "crunch time", just under a different name.
	</p>
	<p>
	To provide some additional context about Matsuo Bashou and his most famous work,<br>
	"The Narrow Road to the Interior", it's worth knowing that it was his last major work,<br>
	with it being completed the same year as his death and published posthumously.<br>
	One could imagine Matsuo Bashou as having given the remainder of his life energy into completing it,<br>
	and this is what I think is being referred to in this explanation. Truthfully, I did not do particularly<br>
	extensive research into this topic, but as far as I can tell, while the creation of "The Narrow Road to the Interior"<br>
	was a laborious process taking many years and lots of refinement, I could find no explicit reference<br>
	to its creation having undergone any sort of "shuraba" or crunch time.
	</p>
	<p>

	<p>
	As for Murasaki Shikibu, she was a Japanese novelist, best known for "The Tale of Genji",<br>
	which is considered to be one of the first novels ever written and is quite long at 1100 pages.<br>
	Her reputation as one of history's first novelists is likely what the description is referring to<br>
	by saying she is believed to be the first person to use "Shuraba Mode" in Japan, as such a grand work<br>
	would have likely required some "shuraba" or crunch time, especially since, as with Matsuo Bashou,<br>
	she spent considerable time writing this novel and is believed to have either died not long after<br>
	its completion or possibly even had it finished by her daughter after her passing.

	As part of the comic Hiyori is drawing in the Hiyori mini scenario, there's a scene<br>
	of Yutaka and Minami looking up into the night sky, with Yutaka being able to see<br>
	a small blue star beside the Big Dipper, known as the "Death Omen Star".
	</p>
	<p>
	As mentioned earlier in these notes, the Death Omen Star is a reference to the series<br>
	"Fist of the North Star", in which being able to see this star is a sign that you will die within a year.

	In the Hiyori mini scenario, there's a choice to have Hiyori<br>
	drink a pep-up drink called "Geass", resulting in the above lines.
	</p>
	<p>
	The drink's name comes from the series "Code Geass", while the CG and line where Hiyori<br>
	makes a command is based on the "Geass" that the protagonist, Lelouch Vi Britannia, possesses.<br>
	Geass is a magical power in which by making direct eye contact with someone while stating a command,<br>
	can force that person to follow that command, no matter what it is. Hiyori's line is mimicking the wording<br>
    that Lelouch used when utilizing his Geass to make soliders shoot themselves with their guns.

	In the Hiyori mini scenario, as the effects of the "Geass" drink<br>
	start to wear off, Hiyori starts acting loopy, leading to her saying this line.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	The line "let them drink drank" is derived from a quote often attributed to historical figure, Marie Antoinette,<br>
	that being "let them eat cake". This is a paraphrasing of what she had supposedly said in response<br>
	to hearing that peasants had no bread to eat, though it is debated whether she actually ever said this.

	Here in the Patty mini-scenario, Patty says the name of the friend she is talking to,<br>

	but as far as I know, she is not, and is original to this scene.
	</p>
	<p>
	As an additional fun fact and oddity, though Patty says "Lilith" in her English voice acting (to the best of my hearing!),<br>
	the original Japanese version of this game provided a Japanese translation of what Patty is saying.<br>
	In that translation, they wrote her name as "リンダ" (Linda), so her name could either be Lilith or Linda<br>
	depending on which of the two you consider to be more trustworthy.
