	The name of the Episode itself is a reference to the 2006 animated film,<br>
	"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time". The above key art for the film was also<br>
	parodied in artwork made to advertise Lucky Star: Ryouou Gakuen Outousai as a whole,<br>
	replacing the film's protagonist, Makoto Konno, with Konata Izumi.

	<p>
	The Unlucky★Sisters segment the protagonist watches before leaving for the first day of school<br>
    is about the "Seven Wonders" of the school. Similar to the concept of the "Seven Wonders of the World",<br>
    in Japan places like schools will often have "Seven Wonders" of their own.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, there's a key difference between the Seven Wonders of the World and these more local Seven Wonders.<br>
	Unlike the Seven Wonders of the World, which is a list of awe-inspiring places, when people<br>
	talk about the "nanafushigi" or Seven Wonders of places like a school in Japan, they are usually referring<br>
	to things like urban legends or mysterious phenomenon associated with a place.
	</p>
	<p>
	The wonders described by Hikage, as well as the wonders listed in the above CG, are some examples of these<br>
	kinds of urban legends that may form a school's "Seven Wonders".
	</p>
	<p>
	Starting with Hikage's wonders, the "red-stained restroom wall" is possibly in reference to the story of "Aka Manto"<br>
	or "Red Mantle". This story revolves around a spirit wearing a red cloak that appears to people in public restrooms,<br>
	in particular haunting the farthest wall, which may be why Hikage refers to the wall as "red-stained".<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	The Aka Manto will present people with an option to choose either red or blue toilet paper, and depending on which<br>
	color is chosen, the person will be killed in a different manner.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e4/aka_manto.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Next there is the "mirror that you can see ghosts in" that Hikage describes,<br>
	which may be a reference to the story of "Bloody Mary", a ghost who appears in mirrors when her name<br>
	is said repeatedly and can predict the future.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e4/bloody_mary.jpg"></img>
	</p>
	<p>
	Now, on to the wonders listed in the CG. For "Music Room Painting", the kinds of paintings you may<br>
	find in the music room at a school of famous musicians and composers such as Beethoven or Bach are generally<br>
	considered to be creepy and are thus easy targets for urban legends to form around them. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Though not from the time period Lucky Star: Ryouou Gakuen Outousai was released in, one example of<br>
	urban legends surrounding music room paintings making their way into Japanese pop culture is the<br>
	music room portraits that come to life in the "Dandadan" series.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e4/music_room_portraits_dandadan.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	For "Mona Lisa", this is of course referring to the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci.<br>
    Similar to the "Music Room Painting", the Mona Lisa is often a painting that will be featured<br>
    in art rooms in Japanese schools, and consequently opens itself up to having similar urban legends<br>
    about it. In particular, there are rumors of such replicas of the Mona Lisa being able to curse you<br>
	if you stare at the woman in the painting for too long. 	
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e4/mona_lisa.jpg"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	For "Statue of Kinjiro Ninomiya", it is in reference to Japanese agriculturalist Kinjiro Ninomiya<br>
	who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries and has since been commemorated with statues of his likeness<br>
	in Japanese schools across Japan as a role model for virtues such as diligence. Consequently, these statues<br>
	have had urban legends form around them in relation to various positive outcomes that may come to you<br>
	by praying near or touching the statue. These positive outcomes usually relate to things like getting<br>
	good grades or other forms of academic success.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e4/kinjiro_ninomiya.jpg"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	For "Hands of the Pool", I was unable to find any specific urban legends about this,<br>
	but one can imagine they relate to the idea of a school swimming pool being haunted and having hands<br>
	that come out from the pool and drag victims under the water.
	</p>
	<p>
	For "Hanako-san of the Toilet", this is arguably the most famous urban legend of the ones<br>
	explicitly listed here. It involves the ghost of a girl named Hanako-san, who was either killed or committed<br>
	suicide, depending on the specific variant of the story, via drowning in a school toilet. Consequently, she haunts<br>
	the toilets of school bathrooms, and may attempt to drag others into the toilet as well.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e4/hanako_san.png"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	As for "Angel-sama", this is in reference to a Japanese board game often played among school children,<br>
	better known by the name "kokkuri-san". It's played with a pen, paper, and a coin and works similar to a<br>
	ouija board. Participants will write the full hiragana table and "yes" and "no" on a sheet of paper, place a coin<br>
	on the paper, and then ask questions. The idea is then that the titular "Angel-sama" will move the coin<br>
	either to the "yes" or "no" to answer yes/no questions, or move to each hiragana character to spell out answers.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="e4/angel_sama.jpg"></img><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Lastly, for "The Curse of the Seven Wonders", I couldn't find anything in particular that this is referencing,<br>
	but one could imagine that it's some sort of overarching urban legend that would surround the Seven Wonders<br>
	of a school as a whole.

	After watching the Unlucky★Sisters segment about it, if the protagonist concludes that his uneasiness<br>
	thinking about the potential Seven Wonders of Ryouou High School is due to him having psychic powers,<br>
	Hinata will chime in saying that everything are "conspiracies foretold my Nostradamus".
	</p>
	<p>
	As discussed in the notes for Episode 2, this is a reference to the manga "MMR: Magazine Mystery Reportage"<br>
	about a group of reporters investigating paranormal phenomena, as well as the prophecies made by Nostradamus<br>
	to determine if they are really true. MMR became well known online for its moments in which a character will<br>
	dramatically come to a conclusion, with the other characters responding in surprise.<br>

	<p>
	During lunch on the third day of Episode 0, during the discussion about potentially staying the night<br>
	at school in order to get the preparations done in time, Konata will complain that she wishes she had<br>
	more time to watch anime. Kagami will then ask why she can't just catch up on it after the festival is over,<br>
	leading to Konata saying the above line.
	</p>
	<p>
	The part about references that aren't fresh being just ordinary references is itself a reference<br>
	to the 1992 Hayao Miyazaki film, "Porco Rosso", which is about a bounty hunter and pilot named<br>
	Marco Pagot, who goes the title "Porco Rosso" ("Crimson Pig" in Italian). He goes by that title<br>
	as he has been turned into an anthropomorphic pig by a curse.
	</p>
	<p>
	At one point during the film, after surviving being shot down by rival pilot, Donald Curtis,<br>
	Marco calls his friend Madame Gina to inform her that he's safe. However, he then follows it up<br>
	by asking her to tell Curtis that he'll be seeing him again, as both he and Marco frequent the<br>
	Hotel Adriano, which she owns.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, this remark infuriates Gina, scolding Marco for continuing to be so reckless<br>
	even after being shot down and how she doesn't want to see him get killed.<br>
	Marco then responds to this by saying "a pig that doesn't fly is just an ordinary pig",<br>
	essentially stating that his life would have no purpose if he gave up flying.<br>
	It is this same sentiment that Konata is trying to echo by making this reference.

	During the "Occ★ult" Unlucky★Sisters segment exclusive to the Episode 4 version of Episode 0,<br>
	when Hikage demands an explanation for why the "2 a.m. Girl" is actually sci-fi and not occult,<br>
	Fuyuki prompts Minami to say the above line as the reason why they cannot elaborate.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	This is a reference to the character "Mikuru Asahina" from "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya",<br>
	who is a time traveller from the future. However, as she is not allowed to reveal details about<br>
	the future to people living in the present, she often uses the term "classified information" as a stand-in<br>
	for such details. She will also use "classified information" as an excuse to not clarify things further<br>
	when she says something that causes characters to wonder what she meant.
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, Minami being the character chosen to say this is because her voice actress,<br>
	Minori Chihara, is the same as another "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" character, "Yuki Nagato".
